Magog is a roguelike game.

= Running the game =

You need to have the Factor language binary installed from
http://factorcode.org/ and in your executable path to run it from source.

*To build a binary*, go to the root of the project directory, start the Factor
runtime with the project in the vocabulary path with

  FACTOR_ROOTS=$PWD factor

then type

  USE: tools.deploy
  "magog" deploy

on the listener.

The binary should appear in a subdirectory "magog" in your Factor binary tree.

*To run the game from the listener* start the Factor listener as above

  FACTOR_ROOTS=$PWD factor

then type

  "magog" run

This will compile the game anew whenever you do it with a fresh listener, this
takes a while. If you're familiar with using custom images with the Factor
listener, you probably want to set one up for yourself. The vocabulary
`magog.build` has utilities for this.

Keeping the listener on and typing "magog" run again will restart the game.
